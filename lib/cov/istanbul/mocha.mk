# Generate coverage in JSON format.
#
# This target uses [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) to
# transparently instrument a [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test suite and
# collect code coverage statistics.
#
# The JSON object generated by Istanbul has the following format:
#
#     {
#          "/path/to/file1.js": { file1 coverage },
#          "/path/to/file2.js": { file2 coverage }
#     }
#
# The internals of the file coverage object are [intentionally not documented][1]
# since it is not a public interface.
#
# NOTE: The `_mocha` executable is used here, rather than `mocha`.  This is due
#       to the fact that `mocha` is a wrapper which spawns `_mocha` as a new
#       process.  This spawning prevents `istanbul` from instrumenting the code,
#       and so `_mocha` is used directly as a workaround.
